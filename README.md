Analysis:-
Multiple R: -  here multiple R talks about the correlation between two variable that means here price is 96% depend on rest all independent variable
R Square:- here higher (93%) R Square values represent smaller differences between the observed data and the fitted values. Here 93% R Square is showing The data point is very close to regression line that means a very low noise in the data which seems fantastic.
Adjusted R Square:-  here Adjusted R-square is 91% which indicates that there are new terms improving in the model that means here overspecified model is more likely to reduce the precision of coefficient estimates and predicted values. You donâ€™t want to include more terms in the model then necessary.
Standard Error:- Here standard error is 55% that indicates here prediction is quite more that means the model is having more dust which is estimation if standard error will be less than it will indicate that model is good(less dust is there).


Sum of square:- sum of square talks about the distance between each data point and the line of best fit is squared and then summed up.
So here the distance between actual and predictable values is 743027 which result indicates
A large degree of variability within the data set.

Mean square :- Here mean square is obtained by dividing the term sum of square by the degree of freedom.
So here treatment mean square, it indicates represent the variation is 185756 between the sample means.

Question solve in python:-
Q1- Design the product with all advanced fetures and predict the price?
data = [['3','4','1','1']]
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data, columns = ['Screen','Capacity', 'Connectivity', 'Gen'])
df2
output:-
	Screen	Capacity	Connectivity	Gen
	3	4	1	1

df2_pred = reg.predict(df2)
print(df2_pred)
output:- [1009.75579572]
so if you take high all advanced features [3,4,1,1] price will be Rs.1009

Q2- Design another product with chepeast price possible?
print(df.min())
output:-
Screen	Capacity	Connectivity	Gen
   1                1                 0                  0
Price 279
Q3- if for the target price is the $400 what best product can be design? List the features.
df_out[df_out['Pred_Price'] < 400]
output:-
Screen	Capacity	Connectivity	Gen
     1             2                  1                  0
